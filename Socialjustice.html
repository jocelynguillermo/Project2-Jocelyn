This graph shows  the average wages in the economy.

<div class="box c"> In the U.S, most of our everyday household items are made in China that is created in these factories. These workers being mistreated is a reflection of  the american economy and consumership. If these 
workers are being mistreated and living in bad conditions it makes the consumer just as bad as the people mistreating the workers. It makes it seem like America is supporting these conditions by consumers still purchasing from these companies. 
The graph shows that the chinese salary is way lower than the american salary. As you can see it is not nearly as much as the United States wage.

These factories is that not only do they overwork there wokers but they do not pay them as well.
This is what it is like for Factory workers.
These workers are  not getting the proper money in order to support themselves and their own families.
Everyday they risk their health in order to very little amount of money. This affects the workers performance.These wprkers deserve to be paid more.
