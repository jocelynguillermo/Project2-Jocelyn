<div class="box c">Chinese Factores have very unsuitable working conditions. It is not just sketchy companies. Big comppainies such as "Apple" has gotten exposed for their working conditions from their plant in China. Workers have confessed that they have been in contact with 
hazardous chemicals such as lead. Exposure to these chemicals can affect their health and can lead to diseases and even death.  Without proper conditions diseases, death , and injuries will affect workers. 
China is known for thier manufactory but with this it comes with a price. Factory workers are underpaid and over worked. They get the same amount of pay when working overtime. It has also been brought up that workers have been working 100 hours a week. It is common
for workers to expierence these conditions. Without proper help thier condtions will not change.<br><a href="scientificdata.html">Scientific data</a><br><a href="Socialjustice.html">Social Justice </a>
